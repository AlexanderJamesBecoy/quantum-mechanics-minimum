# Quantum Mechanics Minimum
Notes and exercises when reading Leonard Susskind and Art Friedman's "Quantum Mechanics: The Theoretical Minimum". Using my spare time to relearn the basics and the mathematics of Quantum Mechanics. Finally, after reading the book, I should be able to create a simple 2D grid simulating the wave function of a particle traversing through free space and a barrier.
